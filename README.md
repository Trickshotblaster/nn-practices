**NN Practices**

This is a repository to hold some of my practice work while forllowing Andrej Karpathy's amazing Neural Networks zero to hero series :)

Some ai (MLP) generated names starting with 'bro':
```
brogyacha.
bro.
brochi.
broda.
brovalley.
brostianael.
brossan.
bron.
brovine.
brondina.
```
And some without context:
```
xybha.
fineluhah.
prynna.
musen.
nily.
shi.
kavlan.
aythouannes.
dafay.
kivina.
riniina.
aabis.
ayelee.
kinroy.
mavi.
haliigh.
reri.
aid.
raclynn.
inden.
```
<h2>things i've learned:</h2>

1) Matmul represents feedforward, where size[0] of the second tensor is the output of the layer before it and size[1] is the number of neurons

2) You can do pretty much anything to make the output and call backward on the loss, it doesn't have to be a conventional neural net. You can do things like multiply and add random numbers and it will all be accounted for.
